W3C Accessible Name Computation Prototype
A functional prototype for the W3C Alternative Text Computation.

Live AccName Test Page
https://whatsock.github.io/w3c-alternative-text-computation/Editable%20Live%20Input%20AccName%20Test.html

The AccName Prototype algorithm code is contained in the file "recursion.js" in the folder "docs/Sample JavaScript Recursion Algorithm", which can be remotely loaded into any project using JavaScript like so.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://whatsock.github.io/w3c-alternative-text-computation/Sample%20JavaScript%20Recursion%20Algorithm/recursion.js"></script>
```

Usage:

  var props = calcNames(elementNode); // Generate the Name and Description properties of an element. ( props.name and props.desc )

alert(props.name); // Show accessible Name property

alert(props.desc); // Show accessible Description property

alert(props.error); // Show error if one is generated. 

The props.error property only populates if the code throws a syntax error. (These should always be reported here as a new issue when discovered.)

Project Details
-----

For testing purposes, a naming computation algorithm has been created using JavaScript for the purpose of simulating the accessible name computation that browsers should be reflecting in the accessibility tree, which has been constructed in accordance with the W3C AccName specification at
http://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/

The W3C Testable Statements Generator script is included, which will automatically generate executable HTML files of all of the testable statements at
https://www.w3.org/wiki/AccName_1.1_Testable_Statements
Which also automatically generates the following index.html file in the output folder for testing on webservers.

To ensure interoperability, the W3C Alternative Text Computation must be supported in all browsers equally.

At present however, accurate recursion within browsers is inconsistently and unreliably supported, and no Assistive Technologies match any of these naming algorithms.

The included test pages demonstrate this, which can be verified using Accessibility Tree examination utilities as documented at
http://whatsock.com/training/#hd2

Conclusion
-----

Whenever external containers are referenced via aria-labelledby or aria-describedby or the HTML label element using matching 'for' and 'id' attributes, the recursive Alternative Text Computation should process the same subtrees even when aria-labelledby and aria-describedby referenced parent containers are hidden using CSS. When comparing these in the Accessibility Tree though, even within the same browsers, these algorithms don't match between the most common browsers.

Additionally, screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA don't come anywhere near conveying the same algorithm, often varying widely across differing browsers despite what is conveyed within the Accessibility Tree.

In the interest of ensuring future interoperability for web technologies across all devices, it would be beneficial for all browsers to equally support the same Alternative Text Computation algorithm, and have the same algorithm supported in ATs like screen readers as well, for all of the previously mentioned interactive elements and ARIA roles. If assistive technologies utilize the accessibility tree to convey this information, then these browser improvements will automatically increase accessibility within these assistive technologies.

Otherwise, it will be impossible to create complex dynamic constructs that are consistently and reliably labelled for Assistive Technology users in the future.
