W3C Accessible Name Computation Prototype
A functional prototype for the W3C Alternative Text Computation.

The Accessible Name Computation Prototype

Live AccName Test Page
https://whatsock.github.io/w3c-alternative-text-computation/Editable%20Live%20Input%20AccName%20Test.html

The AccName Prototype algorithm code is contained in the file "recursion.js" in the folder "docs/Sample JavaScript Recursion Algorithm", which can be remotely loaded into any project using JavaScript like so.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://whatsock.github.io/w3c-alternative-text-computation/Sample%20JavaScript%20Recursion%20Algorithm/recursion.js"></script>
```

Usage:

```
  var props = getAccName(elementNode); // Generate the Name and Description properties of an element. ( props.name and props.desc )
```

```
alert(props.name); // Show accessible Name property
```

```
alert(props.desc); // Show accessible Description property
```

```
alert(props.error); // Show error if one is generated. 
```

The props.error property only populates if the code throws a syntax error. (These should always be reported here as a new issue when discovered.)

Secondary Usage:

```
getAccName( elementNode, function( props ) {
    alert(props.name); // Show accessible Name property
    alert(props.desc); // Show accessible Description property
    alert(props.error); // Show error if one is generated.  
});
```

Project Details
-----

For testing purposes, a naming computation algorithm has been created using JavaScript for the purpose of simulating the accessible name computation that browsers should be reflecting in the accessibility tree, which has been constructed in accordance with the W3C AccName specification at
http://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/

To ensure interoperability, the W3C Alternative Text Computation must be supported in all browsers equally.

This project is meant to mirror the development of the AccName specification, which will be updated accordingly with all expected behaviors as this development continues within the W3C ARIA Working Group.

The W3C Testable Statements Generator script is included, which will automatically generate executable HTML files of all of the testable statements at
https://www.w3.org/wiki/AccName_1.1_Testable_Statements
Which also automatically generates the following index.html file in the output folder for testing on webservers.
